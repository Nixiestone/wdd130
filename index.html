          <p>Edo State's history is rooted in the ancient, powerful Benin Kingdom, renowned for its art and political structure. Colonized by the British in 1897, the kingdom's influence waned, but its cultural legacy remained. The region evolved through the Mid-Western and Bendel States before becoming Edo State in 1991, retaining Benin City as its capital and continuing to carry the rich cultural heritage of its past.</p>
